# Sign up for an SAP HANA Cloud Trial account
<!-- description --> Learn about the SAP HANA Cloud trial and the process to sign up for it.

## Intro
This tutorial is part of a mission, in which you will learn in a hands-on, end-to-end setting how to use SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database. SAP offers two free options to use SAP HANA Cloud. This tutorial covers the first option, which is signing up for the SAP HANA Cloud trial. The trial allows you to use SAP HANA Cloud in a test environment and does not require payment details to sign up, whereas the free tier option can be easily upgraded to a paid version but does require payment details. If you would like to learn more about the second option of using SAP HANA Cloud free tier, proceed to [this tutorial](hana-cloud-mission-trial-2-ft).

  ### Get to know the SAP HANA Cloud trial
-	You can use your trial account to test the following components: **SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database** and **SAP HANA Cloud, data lake**.

-	If your trial account remains inactive, you will be asked to extend your trial every 30 days. If you regularly log in to your trial account, your trial account will be automatically extended up to 90 days.

-	If you already use other services in SAP Business Technology Platform, those will not be affected or limited in any way by your participation in the SAP HANA Cloud trial.

-	Trial database instances are stopped on a nightly basis. Each time you start working with your trial instance, you need to restart it first.

-	If you do not restart your instance within **30 days**, it will be **deleted**. Your trial account, however, will continue to exist and you can easily provision an instance again, if you wish to do so.

-	The configuration of your trial instance of SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database is **30GB of memory, 2vCPUs, and 120GB of storage**.

-   Features such as JSON document store, Script Server, PAL/APL etc. require larger HANA Cloud configurations (3 `vCPUs`, 45G memory) and are therefore *not supported* in a trial account.
