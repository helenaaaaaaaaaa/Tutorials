## Intro

As an IT Admin, you play a pivotal role in determining how effectively your organization can leverage technology. The rise of low-code platforms has democratically opened the doors to software development, making it accessible even to those without formal coding skills. But this doesn't negate the need for expert supervision and user enablement — in fact, this is where a Digital Center of Excellence (CoE) comes into play.

The Digital CoE serves as a guiding force, a one-stop hub, where you can share standardized protocols, best practices, learning content, and support citizen developers in building software solutions. It contains forums and content for skills development and drives the capability of the organisation for using low-code visual programming to create apps, automate processes, and build business sites. Furthermore, it can also be used as a repository for your use-case portfolio. 

In fact, because it is based on SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition, setting up the Digital CoE is also a great first step for you to get to know SAP's low-code tool set.

The Digital CoE can accelerate the time to value of your low-code program by improving IT-readiness, providing a channel for change management, enabling the analysis of use case ideas and portfolio management, and communicating with citizen developers in a way that us business-friendly.

4. Customize your *Do you need help?* area. Lots of citizen developer will visit this page once they are stuck and need help. That's why the call-for-help approach is on the first page. Do you want to offer weekly help sessions like this proposal for the troubleshooting sessions? Do you want to just describe how to get help?
      - In case you want to offer an format: Link the *Events page* from your Work Zone page. Do so by copying the link from the *Internal and External Events* page and insert it as a link to the respective clickable word(s).

### Customize the Product pages

> With the product pages you offer product specific information and explanations to enable everyone!

1. Think about replacing the banner. Is there maybe an engaging photo of something you already built or some people from your own community? This will spark interest and will reduce the hurdles to get started because the own colleagues already started it.
    
    <!-- size:600px -->
    ![Product Page 1](ProductPage1.png)

### Provide information about access & rules

>With the access & rules page you will provide access to the tools for everyone and set the stage for the usage!

1. How do you want to guide your Citizen Developers? This page will provide information on that process to your community. Change your *How to get access* text and describe your plan of usage. You might also want to already make your Citizen Developers aware of your security and compliance regulations as well as agree on your rules.

2. Do you want to provide a sandbox system to your Citizen Developers? Some of them might want to have an extra-safe space to start developing without the fear of “breaking anything”. If so, tell them and also highlight the advantages by using that kind of environment for them – not everyone is familiar with these kind of system landscapes. 

3. Swap out the banner and create your own call-to-action for your employees to directly get access with one click. This could lead them for instance to your testing environment where they can directly start building.
   
    <!-- size:600px -->
    ![Access and Rules 1](Access1.png)

4. What are important information you would want your Citizen Developers to have? Here you can link your security guidelines, IT strategy or in general your guiding principles. Feel free to include everything that would be helpful and beneficial. It might already answer some of the questions your Citizen Developer would ask later on.
   
5. Make your network stay active and have people they can approach directly. This will help your community to start building and actively stay engaged – otherwise they might stop when they are stuck at some point. 
Who knows the best about Data Protection and Privacy or Security? Add the respective colleagues to the Work Zone page and make them visible. 
    
    <!-- size:600px -->
    ![Access and Rules 2](Access2.png)

### Give out your Alpha-Phase manual

>With the alpha-phase manual you make everyone be aware of the situation and follow your rules!

1. Do you want to gradually roll out SAP Build in phases, such as alpha, beta, etc. before making it broadly available? The Alpha-Phase page is the place to tell your Citizen Developer about it. Explain why you chose a phased approach and what would be the benefits for them.

2. Having a smaller or bigger set of rules can help everyone developing in a safe setting and feel comfortable knowing whats allowed and what’s rather not be done. Here you can add your Do’s and Don’t to describe your own environment.
    
    <!-- size:600px -->
    ![Manual 1](Manual1.png)

3.  Add your call-to-action banner to again guide your Citizen Developer to get access after they read the rules.
    
    <!-- size:600px -->
    ![Manual 2](Manual2.png)


### Personalize the motivation and timeline

> With this page you explain the motivation and goal and keep everyone aligned on the timeline!

1. Your Citizen Developer will wonder what the ultimate goal of the rollout is: *Why are we using it? What is the purpose? What will change for us?*. Here you can answer these questions and provide answers. Understanding the background of projects always makes a big difference in the successful adoption and usage of the proposed solution afterwards.
    
    <!-- size:600px -->
    ![Rollout 1](Rollout1.png)

2. Having a written motivation statement strengthens the understanding of the purpose. This way your Citizen Developers are really aligned with your motivation. Customize this text and make it reflect your very own motivation and goal.
   
3. What is the plan for the next months? Maybe your Citizen Developer will decide to start their journey at a later point of time or they simply want to know what to expect in the upcoming time. By customizing this project pipeline with the given PowerPoint Template in the Contents area of the template you can visualize your next goals and milestones. You can also think about adding a call-to-action here for employees to join a specific beta-phase or a feedback-cycle. It’s up to you! 
    
    <!-- size:600px -->
    ![Rollout 2](Rollout2.png)

### Adapt the Use-Case Repository to your needs

> With this page you gather your Use-Cases centrally and let others see whats already built

1. One of the biggest hurdles to start building is uncertainty about what is possible. With this Use-Case repository and the active collaboration of your community this page will turn into an active view of your low-code portfolio that everyone can see and know what is “already out there”. Think about customizing the intro text and make everyone at your company understand the benefit and purpose of this page!

2. By using the Knowledge-Base feature, every new Use-Case which is uploaded to the Work Zone page from your Citizen Developer will automatically appear in this list and turn the Use-Case Repository into an actively used page. Take a look at the settings of the widget – how many entries do you want to be shown? How do you want it to be sorted?

    <!-- size:600px -->
    ![Use-Case Repository 1](UseCase1.png)

3. Take a look at the template of the „Use-Case template“ entry which is provided. Are the requested information sufficient? Do you want to include different types of information? Just directly change the template and make it visible to everyone.
