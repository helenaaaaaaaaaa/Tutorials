# Copy Data Between Data Lake Files Instances Using Python
<!-- description --> Copy a root directory from a source SAP HANA data lake Files instance to a target SAP HANA data lake Files instance. A Python script is provided to execute this copy which leverages the SAP HANA Cloud, data lake Files REST API. 

## Prerequisites
 - Two running non-trial SAP HANA data lake Files instances â€“ a source and a target
 - Both instances added to SAP HANA database explorer; [instructions to add data lake Files container](hana-dbx-connections)
 - Read permissions on the source instance
 - Read and write permissions on the target instance
 - Client certificates set up on both instances, and a copy of the client certificate and client key files for each instance; [instructions to set up certificates](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/08/05/setting-up-initial-access-to-hana-cloud-data-lake-files/)
 - Python 3.10 or later; [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## You will learn
  - How to copy a directory from the source data lake file container to the target data lake file container

## Intro
Note that for simplicity, the same client certificate will be used for both the target and the source instance in this tutorial. 

---

### Set up a directory in the source data lake Files instance

In this step, we will create a directory called `My_Directory` with two subdirectories, `Subdirectory_1` and `Subdirectory_2`, with a file in each subdirectory. The files can be of any format, however this tutorial will use text files. 

1. Create and save the following text files locally. 

    ```File_1.txt
    This is my first text file.
    ```
    Ensure to recall the location of your text files.

    ```File_2.txt
    This is my second text file. 
    ```

2. In database explorer, upload these files to your source HANA data lake Files storage (HDLFS) instance. Upload `File_1.txt`, setting the relative path as `My_Directory/Subdirectory_1`. This will upload the file and create a new directory `My_Directory` with subdirectory `Subdirectory_1`. 

    ![Upload files](upload-files.png)

    ![Upload first file](upload-file-1.png)

3. Upload `File_2.txt` using the relative path `My_Directory/Subdirectory_2`.


### Set up a Python script


1. In this step you will need to access the REST API endpoints for both your source and target HLDFS instances. The REST API endpoint for a given instance can be found by clicking the action menu in SAP HANA Cloud Central. 

    ![Copy REST API endpoint](REST-endpoint.png)

2. Create a Python script beginning with the code below and save the file as `copy_HDLFS.py`. Edit the source and target instance variables with the appropriate REST API endpoints for each of your containers. Edit the certificate variables with the appropriate path to the certificate and key used for both HDLFS containers. 

    ```Python
    # Source information
    SOURCE_FILES_REST_API_ENDPOINT = '<File Container REST API>'

    # Target information
    TARGET_FILES_REST_API_ENDPOINT = '<File Container REST API>'

    # Certificates information
    CERTIFICATE_PATH = '<Path to client.crt>'
    KEY_PATH = '<Path to client.key>'
    ```

### Set up a copy script

1. Append the following code to the end of your `copy_HDLFS.py file`

    ```Python
    # This script copies a directory including all subdirectories and files from a root directory
    # in the source HDLFS instance to the target HDLFS instance.
    
    # This script is run with the following arguments:
    #   root='root_dir_name'
    #       where root_dir_name is the name of the root directory in the source instance
    #       that is being copied
    #   index=i
    #       (optional) where i is a non-negative integer and the index of the file in the source
    #       instance that will be used as a starting point for the copy -- in other words, the first i
    #       files will be skipped and thus will not be copied; if no value is given, the default index 0
    #       will be used -- all files will be copied
    #
    # Ex. The following arguments would execute a copy from root directory 'TPCH_SF100' starting at the
    # file at index 42
    # py copy_HDLFS.py root='TPCH_SF100' index=42

        'from source instance to target instance.')
    print('End time:\t', end)
    print('Elapsed time:\t', end - start)
    ```

### Run the copy script

1. To copy the directory `My_Directory` from the source to the target HDLFS, execute the following in command prompt. 

    ```Terminal
    py copy_HDLFS.py root='My_Directory'
    ```

2. Verify that `My_Directory` as well as its contents are now visible in the target container. 


### Knowledge check

Congratulations! You have now copied the directory `My_Directory` between HDLFS instances.
